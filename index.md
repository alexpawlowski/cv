## Currently

I'm a rising second-year Energy Science and Engineering PhD student at the University of Tennessee, focusing on Transportation Science. So far, I have presented a paper in fuel economy trends and the efficacy of higher octane fuel with scenarios of current spark-ignited combustion engine, and have been cornering funding for a project to address a challenge in gasoline spark ignited engines. Using my background in material science and mechanical engineering, I am identifying how metal additive manufacturing will play a role in advanced engine technologies through the production of casting molds and end use parts. Along the way, I also have taken advantage of working in projects through course at Tennessee in the larger mobility picture. During my PhD I've been working on integrating large volumes of publicly available genomics datasets with chromosome conformation data, exploring the relationships between higher order genome organisation and locus-level chromatin features using machine learning and statistical analysis.

## Projects

### blog

I write a data science blog at [blm.io](http://blm.io) where I apply R and Python to open datasets and write-up the results. My posts have been featured by sites including FiveThirtyEight, BuzzFeed, AVclub, io9 and more, and also led to being an invited blogger at the Huffington Post. My original wordpress blog ([benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com](http://benjaminlmoore.wordpress.com)) has received around 150,000 total views from 180 countries.

### EdinbR
I co-founded a usergroup for the R programming language in Edinburgh called EdinbR. I help to organise our monthly meetings and built our website: [edinbr.org](http://edinbr.org). Our meetings attract 30-50 statisticians, data scientists and developers for talks and discussion about the R language and its applications. We're sponsored by Revolution Analytics and have an organisational github account at [github.com/EdinbR](https://github.com/EdinbR).

### datarea

I entered Imperial College's [Summer Data Challenge](http://summerdatachallenge.com/) competition, where entrants analysed a given dataset and then proposed a startup idea based on their results. I developed a modelling technique to select housing areas for investment and was awarded third place: £2,000 and startup support from Imperial Create Lab. My entry can be seen at [blm.io/datarea](http://blm.io/datarea) and the code is shared on my github account.
